TTY MIDI Keyboard
Author: Calvin Kosmatka <calvin.kosmatka@gmail.com>

This program turns a TTY into an ALSA MIDI keyboard.

Usage:
	tmk [dest_client:dest_port]
	tmk (-h | --help)

The optional dest_client:dest_port argument specifies and ALSA client to connect to. If not specified, aconnect can be used later to connect MIDI output.

White keys are laid out from <a> to <'>. Black keys are on the row above.

The <a> key maps to [C] (MIDI note 60 in the defualt octave)
    <w> maps to [C#/Db]
    ...
    <f> maps to [F]
    <t> maps to [F#/Gb]
    ...
    <k> maps to [C + 1 octave]
    <o> maps to [C#/Db + 1 octave]
    ...
    <'> maps to [F + 1 octave]

The <z> and <x> keys shift the keyboard an octave down and up

Press <q> to quit. <CTRL-C> will not work as expected since tmk uses K_RAW mode for keyboard input.

Press <TAB> to pause output switch back to K_XLATE mode. <CTRL-C>, <CTRL-Z>, and other commands will work as expected while output is paused.
